# Public_CTF_Writeups

Hi! 

This repository shows some of the CTF challenges I completed as a part of my university's cybersecurity club, CU Cyber, and created public writeups for.

## CSAW 2022

[Quantum Leap](/Quantum%20Leap.ipynb) - A custom byte encoding/decoding challenge based on the properties of quantum logic gates. Created as a resource for club members as an example of how to work through a CTF challenge.
